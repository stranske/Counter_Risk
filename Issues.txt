1. [Agent] [M2] Extract CASH amounts from Daily Holdings PDFs and integrate into Repo “Cash” column (All Programs)
## Why
Procedure requires cash amounts from a daily holdings PDF (1-day lag) and manual entry into Repo section.

## Scope
Parse the relevant daily holdings PDF and map cash amounts to Repo counterparties in the All Programs run.

## Non-Goals
- OCR-first approach if tables are extractable (use OCR only as fallback)
- Perfect parsing of every historical PDF variant on day one

## Tasks
- [ ] Add fixtures: 1–2 representative Daily Holdings PDFs (sanitized if needed)
- [ ] Implement `src/counter_risk/parsers/daily_holdings_pdf.py`
- [ ] Extract repo cash by counterparty (ASL, South Street, Buckler, CIBC, Daiwa, etc.)
- [ ] Integrate into exposures rollups and Drop-In filled output
- [ ] Add tests on fixture PDFs (basic sanity: totals > 0, key counterparties present)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Pipeline fills Repo Cash values automatically for All Programs without manual entry
