## Autofix diagnostic note

- Date (UTC): 2026-02-15
- PR: #104
- Gate run: 22037031098
- Head SHA: `e8a301af7f7883aa26c8bb9f3963343634644836`

### Observed context

- Reported failing jobs all failed in `Install dependencies`:
  - `Python CI / lint-ruff`
  - `Python CI / typecheck-mypy`
  - `Python CI / python 3.11`
- This runner cannot access GitHub Actions logs directly, so the exact CI installer traceback was not retrievable.
- Repeated autofix attempts toggling `black`/`ruff`/`mypy` pins did not stabilize the gate, which suggested the failure was likely in the shared install path rather than those tool versions themselves.

### Autofix action

Applied a minimal install-path hardening fix and kept dependency pins synchronized:

- `requirements.lock`
  - Added `setuptools==79.0.1`
  - Added `wheel==0.45.1`
- `requirements-dev.lock`
  - Synced `black` to `26.1.0` (to match `pyproject.toml` and `autofix-versions.env`)
  - Added `setuptools==79.0.1`
  - Added `wheel==0.45.1`
- `requirements.txt`
  - Added `setuptools>=61.0`
  - Added `wheel`

Rationale: the CI setup path used by shared workflows relies on editable installs. Preinstalling build backend requirements reduces installer failures when build isolation cannot fetch build-time tooling from the network path used during CI.

### Local validation

- `python scripts/sync_dev_dependencies.py --check`: passed
- `python scripts/sync_test_dependencies.py`: passed
- `pytest -q tests/test_dependency_version_alignment.py`: passed
- `ruff check src tests`: passed
- `mypy src`: passed

### Caveat

- Exact CI installer behavior could not be replayed in this sandbox due network restrictions.
