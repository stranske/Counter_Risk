## Autofix diagnostic note

- PR: #104
- Gate run: 22037137080
- Head SHA: `b7ada6924c1e66426421e349ab3a9decdbdce1a3`

### Observed context

- Reported failing jobs all failed in `Install dependencies`:
  - `Python CI / lint-ruff`
  - `Python CI / typecheck-mypy`
  - `Python CI / python 3.11`
- Prior autofix attempts repeatedly oscillated tool pins between:
  - newer set (`black==26.1.0`, `ruff==0.15.1`, `mypy==1.19.1`), and
  - older set (`black==24.10.0`, `ruff==0.15.0`, `mypy==1.18.2`).
- The repeated failure signature remained tied to Python 3.11 install steps and could not be replayed exactly in this sandbox due restricted network access.

### Autofix action

Applied a minimal, targeted rollback for `black` only in project dependency sources:

- `pyproject.toml`
  - `black==26.1.0` -> `black==24.10.0`
- `requirements.lock`
  - `black==26.1.0` -> `black==24.10.0`
- `requirements-dev.lock`
  - `black==26.1.0` -> `black==24.10.0`

Rationale: `black` is pulled through editable install (`-e .[app,dev]`) in the reusable CI install step even when format checks are disabled. Reverting only this pin minimizes change while addressing the most likely Python 3.11 compatibility break.

### Local validation

- `python scripts/sync_test_dependencies.py`: passed
- `pytest -q tests/test_dependency_version_alignment.py`: passed
- `ruff check src tests`: passed
- `mypy src`: passed

### Caveat

- `python scripts/sync_dev_dependencies.py --check` may report expected drift versus `.github/workflows/autofix-versions.env`, which is not edited under current guardrails.
- Exact CI installer traceback was unavailable in this environment.
