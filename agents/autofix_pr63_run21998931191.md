## Autofix diagnostic note

- Date (UTC): 2026-02-13
- PR: #63
- Gate run: 21998931191
- Head SHA: `9ce02a875fbcf465a18f15fec1608c205dffac17`
- Reported state: `cancelled`
- Reported failing jobs: none

### Local reproduction checks

Commands run from repository root:

```bash
make lint
make test
```

Observed result:

- `make lint`: passed
- `make test`: passed (59 passed, 1 skipped)

No reproducible failing check was found from the available context.
Recommended next step is to re-run CI for this SHA and capture the first concrete failing job log if cancellation recurs.
