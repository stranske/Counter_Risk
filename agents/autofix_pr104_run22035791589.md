## Autofix diagnostic note

- Date (UTC): 2026-02-15
- PR: #104
- Gate run: 22035791589
- Head SHA: `f283266c6303db60532a9b02a61c7713954d3d94`

### Observed context

- Failing jobs reported failure at `Install dependencies`:
  - `Python CI / typecheck-mypy`
  - `Python CI / python 3.11`
  - `Python CI / lint-ruff`
- This runner cannot access GitHub Actions logs/API, so the exact package error text from CI was not retrievable here.
- Recent PR history showed repeated toggling between two tool pin sets. The failing heads were associated with the newer pin set.

### Autofix action

Reverted dev tool pins to the previous known-good set and kept files consistent:

- `pyproject.toml`
  - `black==24.10.0`
  - `ruff==0.15.0`
  - `mypy==1.18.2`
- `requirements.lock`
  - `black==24.10.0`
  - `ruff==0.15.0`
  - `mypy==1.18.2`
- `requirements-dev.lock`
  - `black==24.10.0`
  - `ruff==0.15.0`
  - `mypy==1.18.2`

### Local validation

- `python scripts/sync_test_dependencies.py`: passed
- `pytest -q tests/test_dependency_version_alignment.py`: passed

### Caveat

- `python scripts/sync_dev_dependencies.py --check` reports drift against `.github/workflows/autofix-versions.env` (newer pin file values).
- `.github/workflows/**` is protected in this environment, so `autofix-versions.env` was not edited.
