## Autofix diagnostic note

- Date (UTC): 2026-02-15
- Gate run: `22034661086`
- PR: `#128`
- Failing steps reported: `Install dependencies` in `python 3.11`, `typecheck-mypy`, `lint-ruff`

### Investigation summary

- Direct CI logs for run `22034661086` were not accessible from this runner (`gh run view ...` failed due network access restrictions in the execution environment).
- Failure shape is Python 3.11-specific (`python 3.12` was not listed as failed), which indicates a version pin compatibility issue rather than a general resolver break.
- The lock/dev stack currently pins `black==26.1.0`; this pin was introduced in PR #128 autofix commits and is a likely 3.11-compatibility regression point.

### Change made

- Rolled back `black` pin to the prior known-good line (`24.10.0`) in:
  - `pyproject.toml`
  - `requirements.lock`
  - `requirements-dev.lock`

This keeps the fix targeted to dependency install behavior without touching workflows.

### Local verification

- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_dependency_version_alignment.py` -> passes.
- `python scripts/sync_dev_dependencies.py --check` now reports expected drift because central workflow pin file still declares `BLACK_VERSION=26.1.0`.

### Follow-up if CI still fails

- Capture and attach the first concrete resolver error line from the failed install step (for example, `No solution found ...` or `requires Python >=...`).
- If the resolver explicitly references `BLACK_VERSION=26.1.0`, this repo cannot fully self-heal under current guardrails because `.github/workflows/autofix-versions.env` is protected in standard agent mode.
