## Autofix diagnostic note

- Date (UTC): 2026-02-15
- Gate run: `22034549979`
- PR: `#128`
- Failing steps reported: `Install dependencies` in `python 3.11`, `typecheck-mypy`, `lint-ruff`

### Investigation summary

- This repo delegates Python CI to `stranske/Workflows` reusable workflow.
- The reusable install step installs:
  - `-r requirements.lock`
  - `-e .[app,dev]`
  - explicit tool pins from `.github/workflows/autofix-versions.env`
  - `pytest-xdist` for all relevant jobs
- Previous autofix changed only `requirements-dev.lock`, which is not part of that install path.

### Change made

- Added `pytest-xdist==3.8.0` to `pyproject.toml` dev dependencies.
- Added the same pin to:
  - `requirements.lock`
  - `requirements-dev.lock`

This makes install inputs deterministic for a package that is always installed by the reusable CI workflow, reducing resolver drift across jobs.

### Local verification

- `python scripts/sync_dev_dependencies.py --check` -> passes
- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_dependency_version_alignment.py` -> passes
- Could not fully reproduce `uv pip install` behavior in this environment because package-index network access is unavailable.
