## Autofix diagnostic note

- Date (UTC): 2026-02-13
- PR: #63
- Gate run: 21999055864
- Head SHA: `e25811c137f152ff406f669bb3fbc778642fae15`
- Reported state: `cancelled`
- Reported failing jobs:
  - `Python CI / lint-ruff` (cancelled)
  - `Python CI / python 3.12` (cancelled)
  - `Python CI / typecheck-mypy` (cancelled)
  - `Python CI / python 3.11` (cancelled)

### Local reproduction checks

Commands run from repository root:

```bash
ruff check src tests
mypy src tests
pytest -q
python scripts/sync_test_dependencies.py
```

Observed results:

- `ruff check src tests`: passed
- `mypy src tests`: passed (`Success: no issues found in 30 source files`)
- `pytest -q`: passed (`59 passed, 1 skipped`)
- `python scripts/sync_test_dependencies.py`: passed (`All test dependencies are declared in pyproject.toml`)

Additional note:

- `bash scripts/check_test_dependencies.sh` fails in this runner due missing local tools/packages
  (`hypothesis`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `jsonschema`, `uv`), but this is environment-dependent and
  not a repository code failure signal. The cancelled CI run did not reach dependency install/check
  completion, so no actionable failing stack trace is available.

Recommended next step:

- Re-run CI for this SHA. If cancellation recurs, capture the first non-cancelled failed step log
  so autofix can target a concrete defect.
