## Autofix diagnostic note

- Date (UTC): 2026-02-15
- Gate run: `22034485619`
- PR: `#128`
- Failing steps reported: `Install dependencies` in `typecheck-mypy`, `lint-ruff`, `python 3.11`

### Root-cause hypothesis

`requirements-dev.lock` was stale versus `pyproject.toml` and `.github/workflows/autofix-versions.env`:

- `black` `24.10.0` vs `26.1.0`
- `mypy` `1.18.2` vs `1.19.1`
- `ruff` `0.15.0` vs `0.15.1`
- `pydantic` `2.7.4` vs `2.10.3`
- Missing pins now required by `pyproject.toml` (`openpyxl`, `pandas`)

If CI installs from both lockfile and editable project extras, these mismatches can make dependency resolution fail during install.

### Change made

- Updated `requirements-dev.lock` to align with current `pyproject.toml`/autofix tool pins and include missing requirements.

### Local verification

- `python scripts/sync_dev_dependencies.py --check` -> passes (`All dev dependency versions are in sync`)
- Could not fully validate dependency installs in this environment due restricted network access to package index.
