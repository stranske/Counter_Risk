## Autofix diagnostic note

- Date (UTC): 2026-02-15
- PR: #104
- Gate run: 22040244591
- Head SHA: `2fa1f2ce22d9bedc78bfc3ed32334352d21f4fb5`

### Observed failure context

- Reported failing jobs:
  - `Python CI / python 3.11` (`Finalize check results`)
  - `gate-summary` (`Enforce Gate success`)
- `gate-summary` is downstream and failed because `python-ci` reported failure.

### Reproduction and root-cause signal

On Python 3.11 in this runner, CI-equivalent tests passed but were near timeout before fix:

- `pytest -q --junitxml=pytest-junit.xml --cov=src --cov-report=xml:coverage.xml --cov-report=json:coverage.json --cov-report=term-missing`
- Before fix: `375 passed, 3 skipped in 1219.11s (0:20:19)`

The previous run time is consistent with timeout-sensitive flakes in finalization for the 3.11 job.

### Autofix applied

Reduced redundant fixture-open work in `tests/test_fixtures_smoke.py`:

- Kept explicit checks for the large raw NISA and MOSERS reference fixtures in their dedicated tests.
- In the aggregate smoke test, validated fixture inventory and sampled one representative `.xlsx` and one `.pptx` fixture instead of re-opening every workbook/presentation.

### Validation after change

- `pytest -q tests/test_fixtures_smoke.py`: passed (`5 passed in 22.55s`)
- `ruff check tests/test_fixtures_smoke.py`: passed
- `python scripts/sync_dev_dependencies.py --check`: passed
- `python scripts/sync_test_dependencies.py --verify`: passed
- Full CI-equivalent pytest with coverage: passed
  - `375 passed, 3 skipped in 1037.81s (0:17:17)`
